        üëã Hello! I'm a passionate Information Technology undergraduate at VGEC,
        Ahmedabad, affiliated with Gujarat Technological University (GTU). With
        a strong focus on frontend development and UI/UX design, I love bringing
        clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences to life.
        <br />
        üõ†Ô∏è My technical toolkit includes React, JavaScript, and a deep
        appreciation for typography and interface aesthetics. Whether I‚Äôm
        wireframing a layout or fine-tuning a component, I aim to make every
        interaction intuitive and visually satisfying.
        <br />
        üåø When I‚Äôm not coding or designing, you‚Äôll find me immersed in music,
        watching or playing cricket, or reconnecting with nature‚Äîall of which
        shape my creative energy and problem-solving mindset.
